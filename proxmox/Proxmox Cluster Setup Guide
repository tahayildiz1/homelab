1. Log in to the first Proxmox server, select Datacenter, then Cluster, and select Create Cluster.

2. Give the cluster a name, then select create. The cluster will then be created and you’ll be able 
   to join it from other Proxmox instances.
   
Firewall Rules – How to Set Up a Cluster in Proxmox

1. On the first Proxmox server, select Datacenter, Firewall, then Add to create a new firewall rule.
2. Create the first rule below for UDP port 5404:

    Direction: In
    Action: Accept
    Protocol: UDP
    Source: Proxmox Node 2’s IP Address
    Source Port: 5404
    Destination Port: 5404
    Comment: Allow 5404

3. Create the second rule below for UDP port 5405:

    Direction: In
    Action: Accept
    Protocol: UDP
    Source: Proxmox Node 2’s IP Address
    Source Port: 5405
    Destination Port: 5405
    Comment: Allow 5405
    
4. Create the third rule below for TCP port 22.

    Direction: In
    Action: Accept
    Protocol: TCP
    Source: Proxmox Node 2’s IP Address
    Source Port: 22
    Destination Port: 22
    Comment: Allow 22
    
5. Create the same three rules on the second Proxmox node, but with the correct source IP address 
   (IP address of Proxmox node 1).
   
Joining a Cluster – How to Set Up a Cluster in Proxmox

1. On the device you just set up the cluster with (pve-test in my example), select Join Information 
   under Cluster.

2. The join information will be displayed. You will need both, the Fingerprint and Join Information 
    to join the cluster. Select Copy Information, then open your second Proxmox node.

3. On the second Proxmox node, select Datacenter, Cluster, and Join Cluster.

4. Paste in the information and the peer address and fingerprint will display. In the Password section, 
   enter the root password of the other Proxmox server, then select Join [CLUSTER_NAME].
  
5. If the firewall rules are set up correctly, the cluster should join properly 
   (though it may take a few minutes)!
